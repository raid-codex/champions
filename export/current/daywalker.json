  "lore": "<p>In his past life, Daywalker was a common gravedigger in Kaerok. He lived his grim but ordinary life without complaint, until one day the corpse was brought to him of a lonely old man that had passed away in the slums abutting Kaerok Castle. The man had neither relatives nor acquaintances, nor coin to pay the Telerian priests to give the last rites.</p><p>Taking pity on the wretch, the young gravedigger took it upon himself to bury the man. Preparing the body for burial, he found a strange scroll in the man's pocket.</p><p>Upon the reading, it was a dying manâ€™s last wish to pronounce the words of a strange ritual over his body. Struggling with the unfamiliar glyphs, he spoke. The morning after, the young man left the Kaerok, and headed towards the Hallowed Halls.</p><p>His old name forgotten, his visage fell and terrible, he struck down all he met upon his path. The soul of Daywalker had found its newest vessel.</p>"
