  "lore": "<p>In his childhood, Gatorâ€™s magical ability was out of control - presenting a danger to himself and others. Were it not for a travelling magi belonging to the Coven, he would have likely killed himself with one failed spell or the other. But fate saw fit to give the young lizardman another chance and provide him with tutors open-minded enough to pass their knowledge to a creature many would not see as anything beyond a beast. Such good fortune was not wasted, and when Gator returned to his people, it was a full-fledged mage, well-versed in arts that not many shamans would dare to replicate.</p>"
