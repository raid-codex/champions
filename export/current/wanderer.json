  "lore": "<p>The Wanderer is one of the most infamous of all Dark Elven warriors. A silent fighter of awesome ability, skill, and cunning, before his fall from grace he had once served as Queen Eva's personal bodyguard and - if the rumors are to be believed – personal assassin.</p><p>Those days have long since passed, and his story is now one of exile. Charged with the Queen’s safekeeping during the height of the wars with Kaerok, he abandoned his place at her side to seek out a legendary blade in the lands beyond the Dark Ravine. Said to cut even the strongest of tempered steel, it rests now at his side – but the price was dear.</p><p>The lands of Aravia and the road back to Darkwoord Forest are closed to him for his betrayal. With a price upon his head, his kin will not risk the Queen’s wrath to give him welcome. And so, he wanders Teleria endlessly, friend to none, a dark servant without a master...</p>"
