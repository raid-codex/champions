  "lore": "<p>It is no surprise that the cutthroat society of the Dark Elves produces many skilled warriors and assassins. The latter are especially thought after by anyone in Teleria who needs a problem resolved in a swift and bloody manner. Fortunately for her employers, and unfortunately for her victims, the assassin known as the Eviscerator specializes exactly in that. Her gruesome monicker is well-earned, as a bloody trail of successful \"contracts\" left behind would attest. Of course, there is more than simple cruelty at play. In this bloody business a fear-inspiring reputation is certainly quite important.</p><p>Granted, that reputation is coupled with impressive talent. Eviscerator is as lethal as she is graceful, striking with blinding speed and always seeking to find a weak point in the enemy's defenses. Her dual daggers are coated in poison, making certain that even the smallest scratch has a chance of bleeding her victim. Her agility allows to strike from the shadows, throwing enemy formations into disarray. She knows that it would be foolish to let an enemy recover, and always seeks to strike whenever they attempt to recuperate or gain an advantage.</p>"
