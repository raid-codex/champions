  "lore": "<p>The profane hierarchy of Siroth’s legions is not unlike that of the mortal nobility in Teleria. There is protocol, a certain twisted propriety in demonic dealings, there are ranks and titles. The Marquis and Marquesses stand high in this hierarchy, serving as tacticians and commanders of the Demonspawn hosts.</p><p>Some they there were mortals once, before Siroth’s servants came to Teleria. Driven by fear or ambition, a terrible pact has been made by the nobles to retain their status, yet at a dear price - their very souls. Servants of Lumaya say that any mortal to be foolish enough to sign such a pact lives on in torment, their consciousness entrapped in suffocating, eternal darkness. Survive they will, though most will - in time - beg for the release of death.</p><p>And yet there is never a lack of those who are willing to test these tales for the promise of power.</p>"
