Sworn to service until death or dismissal, he wields a blade crafted in the forges of Fire Knight's Keep, and quenched in the blood of orcs – a blade he is honor-bound to fall upon should his Lord die in battle.</p><p>Like all in service to his master’s house, his armor and hair are dyed a bold azure – a sign of the unbreakable faith in his liege. A master swordsman, the Retainer also possesses the elven gift of hypnosis.</p>"
